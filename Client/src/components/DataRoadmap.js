        text: "The metaverse has become the new world for several decades. In order to maintain order and respect for the rules, a peace militia called “the Elite” was created and assigned to enforce the law in this new world. Unfortunately, over the years, the system has become increasingly harsh and a dictatorship has quickly established itself in this new world. This new elite was governing and surrounding all the people living in the metaverse. A group of eight friends began to rebel and show their displeasure for this new system. Hatred filled their hearts, until one day they couldn't stand it anymore."

The eight friends from the beginning have been chosen by the king of darkness for their eternal loyalty to become the leaders of the eight clans that will compose the Metazork army. Each one has created its own Ork family to diversify training, specialties and features. The Dark King kept a very special surprise for the community. He decided to bring eight creatures from the depths of the Darkverse and turn them into legendary Orks with extremely dark powers in order to help the Metazork army to achieve their goal.'

        text:"Over the past few days, the tension within the community has become so intense that clashes have broken out among the Orks. The leaders decided to banish some of them forever, in order to send a very important message to the whole community: If you don't keep your final goal in mind, you will be distracted by parasites that will hold you back and make you procrastinate. Before we can control our environment, we must first control ourselves. The community has now understood the message, and that's why they train day and night to improve and implement a flawless plan of attack. By focusing on their goals, the 3,500 Orks are slowly but surely moving toward their ultimate objective. Strong but also very smart, the leaders are at the forefront of all plans and strategies whether it be short or long term."
